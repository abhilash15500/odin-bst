# Binary Search Tree in JavaScript  

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript.

## Features
- **Insertion**: Adds nodes while maintaining BST properties.
- **Deletion**: Removes nodes and adjusts the tree accordingly.
- **Find**: Searches for a specific value in the tree.
- **Inorder Traversal**: Visits nodes in sorted order (Left, Root, Right).
- **Preorder Traversal**: Visits the root node first, then left and right subtrees.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Visits left and right subtrees first, then the root node.
- **Level-order Traversal**: Traverses the tree level by level.
- **Re-balance**: Converts an unbalanced BST into a balanced one.
- **Is-Balanced** : Returns a boolean value if tree is unbalanced or not.
- **Height Calculation**: Determines the height of a node/tree.
- **Depth Calculation** : Determines the height of a node/tree
- **Find method** : finds a node in the tree.

## What I Learned
- Got a solid understanding of **BST fundamentals**, including how they are structured and function.
- Worked with **recursion and iteration** to implement tree operations.
- Learned how to handle **edge cases**, like deleting nodes with different numbers of children.
